### US-EP0-BE-001: Backend Modular Monolith Structure and Scaffolding

**Story ID**: US-EP0-BE-001
**Epic Link**: EPIC-0
**Priority**: Must Have
**Effort Estimate**: 8

**As a** Backend Engineer,
**I want to** establish a backend modular monolith repository structure with clear module boundaries and configuration patterns,
**So that** all team members can develop and test code with consistent project organization.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Given the backend repository is cloned, then folder structure includes modules/, shared/, config/, and tests/ directories.
- [ ] Given a backend service is added, then it follows consistent package structure (models/, services/, handlers/, tests/).
- [ ] Given a developer runs setup script, then all dependencies are installed and project is ready for local development.
- [ ] Given a developer adds a new module, then import paths use consistent absolute or relative patterns.

**Deliverables**:

- Backend repository root with modules/, shared/, config/, and tests/ directories.
- Backend service template with boilerplate models, services, and handlers.
- Setup script (setup.sh or equivalent) for fast local environment configuration.
- Configuration management foundation (.env, settings module) for dev/test/staging/prod.
- README with folder structure documentation.

**Dependencies**:

- [Architecture Solution Design](../../03-architecture/core/architecture-solution-design.md).
- [Technology Stack](../../03-architecture/core/technology-stack.md).

**Success Metrics**:

- First-time setup completes in under 15 minutes.
- Backend repository modular structure is documented and consistent.
- All imports follow agreed pattern (no mixed relative/absolute paths).

### US-EP0-BE-002: Database Schema, Migrations, and Seed Data

**Story ID**: US-EP0-BE-002
**Epic Link**: EPIC-0
**Priority**: Must Have
**Effort Estimate**: 8

**As a** Backend Engineer,
**I want to** implement database schema with migration tooling and seed data generation,
**So that** developers can initialize a local database in one command with realistic test data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Given a developer runs a setup command, when the script executes, then database schema is created with all required tables.
- [ ] Given schema changes are made, when migration is versioned and applied, then backward compatibility is checked (if applicable).
- [ ] Given a developer needs test data, when seed script is run, then realistic sample clients, projects, and stories are populated.
- [ ] Given database is re-initialized, when migration is rolled back and re-applied, then idempotency is verified.

**Deliverables**:

- Database schema SQL or ORM migration definitions (based on [Database Design](../../03-architecture/database/database-design.md)).
- Migration tooling configuration (Alembic, Flyway, or equivalent).
- Seed data script with realistic MVP test fixtures.
- Migration documentation and rollback procedures.
- CI/CD integration for schema validation before merge.

**Dependencies**:

- [Database Design](../../03-architecture/database/database-design.md).
- [ADR-007: ORM Choice](../../03-architecture/adrs/adr-007-orm-choice.md).

**Success Metrics**:

- Database initialization is repeatable and idempotent.
- Seed data includes realistic scenarios (3 clients, multiple projects, various story statuses).
- Migration rollback is tested and documented.

### US-EP0-BE-003: CI/CD Pipeline Scaffolding and Testing Framework

**Story ID**: US-EP0-BE-003
**Epic Link**: EPIC-0
**Priority**: Must Have
**Effort Estimate**: 8

**As a** Backend Engineer,
**I want to** set up automated testing framework, linting, and CI/CD pipeline that runs on every commit,
**So that** code quality is enforced and integration issues are caught early.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Given code is committed and pushed, when CI pipeline runs, then unit tests are executed and results are reported.
- [ ] Given test coverage falls below 70%, when CI runs, then build fails with coverage report.
- [ ] Given code style violations exist, when linting is run, then issues are reported and block merge.
- [ ] Given dependencies have known vulnerabilities, when security scan runs, then alerts are triggered.
- [ ] Given all checks pass, when merge approval is granted, then green status is shown on PR.

**Deliverables**:

- Unit testing framework setup (pytest or equivalent) with configuration.
- Linting and code formatting tools (black, flake8, or equivalent) integrated into CI.
- Code coverage measurement and reporting (pytest-cov or equivalent).
- Security dependency scanning (bandit, safety, or equivalent).
- GitHub Actions or equivalent CI/CD configuration (.github/workflows).
- Documented test running and coverage checking procedures.

**Dependencies**:

- [Technology Stack](../../03-architecture/core/technology-stack.md).
- [ADR-009: Testing Framework](../../03-architecture/adrs/adr-010-testing-framework.md).

**Success Metrics**:

- CI pipeline runs in under 5 minutes.
- Test coverage baseline established and enforced (70%+).
- Linting, security, and coverage checks block non-conforming PRs.

### US-EP0-BE-004: API Documentation Foundation and Contract Definition

**Story ID**: US-EP0-BE-004
**Epic Link**: EPIC-0
**Priority**: Must Have
**Effort Estimate**: 5

**As a** Backend Engineer,
**I want to** establish API documentation structure (OpenAPI/Swagger) and baseline endpoint contracts,
**So that** frontend engineers and external stakeholders can reference a single source of truth for API behavior.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Given API is documented, when I review the documentation, then all MVP endpoints are listed with method, path, and expected responses.
- [ ] Given API changes, when documentation is updated, then changes are reflected automatically (generated from code annotations).
- [ ] Given a developer uses the API, when they access documentation, then request/response examples are clear and executable.

**Deliverables**:

- OpenAPI/Swagger specification file (openapi.yml or json).
- API documentation generation setup (Swagger UI, ReDoc, or equivalent).
- Baseline endpoint contracts linking to [API Contract](../../03-architecture/api/api-contract.md).
- Documentation generation in CI/CD pipeline.
- README section on accessing and updating API documentation.

**Dependencies**:

- [API Contract](../../03-architecture/api/api-contract.md).
- [Technology Stack](../../03-architecture/core/technology-stack.md).

**Success Metrics**:

- API documentation is auto-generated from code and available in CI artifacts.
- All MVP endpoints are documented with examples.

## Frontend Engineer

### US-EP0-FE-001: React App Scaffolding and Development Environment

**Story ID**: US-EP0-FE-001
**Epic Link**: EPIC-0
**Priority**: Must Have
**Effort Estimate**: 5

**As a** Frontend Engineer,
**I want to** scaffold a React application with build tooling, development server, and project structure,
**So that** frontend development can begin with a consistent, fast-rebuild development environment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] Given the frontend repository is cloned, when the dev server starts, then the app loads at localhost:3000 within 5 seconds.
- [ ] Given a file is modified, when the browser tab is refreshed, then hot-reload shows changes immediately (within 2 seconds).
- [ ] Given TypeScript or JSX is used, then linting and type-checking provide real-time feedback in the editor.
- [ ] Given the app is built, when production build completes, then output is optimized and under code-split warnings.

**Deliverables**:

- React app scaffolding with Create React App, Vite (per [Technology Stack](../../03-architecture/core/technology-stack.md)).
- Development server configuration with fast rebuild and hot reload.
- Directory structure: src/components/, src/pages/, src/services/, src/styles/, public/.
- TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled.
- ESLint and Prettier configuration integrated.

- [Technology Stack](../../03-architecture/core/technology-stack.md).
- [ADR-002: Frontend Framework](../../03-architecture/adrs/adr-003-frontend-framework.md).

**Success Metrics**:

- Frontend development environment starts reliably and supports rapid iteration.
- Linting and type-check checks are integrated into local and CI workflows.
