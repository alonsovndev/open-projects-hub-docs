**Status**: TODO

**Epic Description:**
Problem Statement: Delivery teams cannot begin engineering work until the development environment, CI/CD, database schema, seed data, and deployment foundations are configured.

Objective: Establish the foundational project structure, local environment setup, and deployment baseline so all engineering teams can work in parallel on MVP features downstream.

Included scope:

- Repository structure and folder organization for one backend modular monolith repo and one frontend repo
- Local development environment setup (Python, Node.js, Docker, database)
- CI/CD pipeline scaffolding and basic testing framework integration
- Database schema creation and seed data generation
- Deployment platform setup (staging and production readiness)
- API contract and documentation foundation

Excluded scope:

- Feature-specific implementation beyond structure and scaffolding
- Team onboarding and documentation beyond setup-critical items
- Advanced deployment automation or multi-region strategies

Related feature and requirement IDs: Foundational (no direct feature mapping; supports all features F-001 through F-011)

Dependencies:

- [Architecture Solution Design](../../03-architecture/core/architecture-solution-design.md)
- [Technology Stack](../../03-architecture/core/technology-stack.md)
- [Database Design](../../03-architecture/database/database-design.md)

Measurable success criteria:

- Every engineer can clone both repositories and run local dev environments in under 15 minutes.
- CI/CD pipeline runs on every commit and reports clear pass/fail status.
- Database schema is created and seed data is populated automatically in local dev.
- Deployment to staging is repeatable and documented.
